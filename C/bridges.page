<title>Bridges</title>

<p>
 Most <link xref='transports'>Pluggable Transports</link>, such as obfs3
 and obfs4, rely on the use of “bridge” relays. Like ordinary Tor relays, bridges
 are run by volunteers; unlike ordinary relays, however, they are not listed
 publicly, so an adversary cannot identify them easily. Using bridges in
 combination with pluggable transports helps to disguise the fact that you
 are using Tor.
</p>

<p>
Other pluggable transports, like meek, use different
anti-censorship techniques that do not rely on bridges. You do not need
to obtain bridge addresses in order to use these transports.

 <title>Getting bridge addresses</title>
 <p>
 Because bridge addresses are not public, you will need to request them
 yourself. You have two options:
 </p>

    <p>
    Visit <link href='https://bridges.torproject.org/'>https://bridges.torproject.org/</link>
    and follow the instructions, or

    address, or

 <title>Entering bridge addresses</title>
 <p>
 Once you have obtained some bridge addresses, you will need to enter them
 into Tor Launcher.
 </p>

 <p>
 Choose “yes” when asked if your Internet Service Provider blocks connections to 
 the Tor network. Select “Use custom bridges” and enter each bridge address
 on a separate line.
 </p>

 <p>
 Click “Connect”. Using bridges may slow down the connection compared to
 using ordinary Tor relays. If the connection fails, the bridges you
 received may be down. Please use one of the above methods to obtain
 more bridge addresses, and try again.
